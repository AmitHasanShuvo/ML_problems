# Tensorflow-Practice

This is a repo I use often to brush up my skills in Tensorflow and to learn what I've left out before.

## Usage

You can run all the scripts individually by having all the required dependencies installed in your machine. Please note that you should have all the other scripts in your same local directory in order for the imports to work properly.
